# Corpora

To steal Darius' description of [his Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora):

> A collection of small corpuses of interesting data for the creation of bots and similar stuff.

It's a collection of JSON files of various bits of data I've collected when making [bots](https://knightbot.rknight.me/) and other web projects.

Directories have a readme if required.
